    "## Objective:  \n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to explore the concept of bias in data science by examining variability of quality and quantity of data. To do this we will examine how politicians from various countries are covered on Wikipedia including quantity as well as quality of coverage. We will create four charts for this analysis including: \n",
    "- 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population\n",
    "- 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population\n",
    "- 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of number of GA and FA-quality articles as a proportion of all articles about politicians from that country\n",
    "- 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of GA and FA-quality articles as a proportion of all articles about politicians from that country"
